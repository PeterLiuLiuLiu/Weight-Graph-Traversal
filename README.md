# Weighted-Graph-Traversal

## This uses Dikjstra to figure out the shortest path of traversal from source node to destination node, if any. Each node, if connected, has an edge which contains a weight for shortest path algorithm to be run proopertly. 

## Please run check out the graph_test.c for how to use the files.
